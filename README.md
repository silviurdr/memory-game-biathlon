## Biathlon Memory Game

This is a classic memory game, personalized with siblings from biathlon.

### Quick Intro

- Instructions available in the game page.
- After you discover all the siblings pair, you'll see a brief presentation of all the biathletes.


### Technologies used

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Photoshop


### Design

Since this is a classic game, I've decided to give it a retro look. 


### Tips

- Don't get intimidated if you've never seen a biathlete before. I've made the game easy, using hints which will help you match the biathlete siblings (same costume color/design, country flags on caps, twins and other similarities you'll discover fast).
